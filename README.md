# INFT2051 Mobile App Project

A functional mobile app prototype developed as part of the INFT2051 Mobile Application Development course at the University of Newcastle. Built using .NET MAUI, the app features location-based navigation, custom UI components, and SQLite database integration. The project focused on cross-device performance through customized fonts, themes, and platform-specific configurations. Development followed an Agile approach, with milestones independently planned and refined through regular feedback sessions.
